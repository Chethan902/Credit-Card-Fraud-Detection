# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
I developed a Credit Card Fraud Detection model using Python and Scikit-learn to identify fraudulent transactions. I performed data cleaning, EDA, and handled class imbalance using resampling techniques. I trained classification models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest and evaluated them using precision, recall, and F1-score.
